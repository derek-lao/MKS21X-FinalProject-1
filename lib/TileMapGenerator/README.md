## Features

* Map generation engine in given specifications

* Adjustable Map size

* Adjustable MapViewer scale-size

* Adjustable TileTypes colors & ids

* Detailed Map-Layer specifications

* Adjustable size & scale & step-size feature of each Map-Layer

* Advanced Map sample & noise pattern generation engine

* Configurable random seed for each Map-Layer

* Unique, fully randomized Map generation

## How To Use

**Warning: You must use power-of-two values for map-size**

**Warning: You must use least 128x128 values for map-size**

* Define your unique Random

```java
private static final Random random = new Random(System.currentTimeMillis());
```

* Define your own LayerSettings

```java
LayerSetting patternLayerSetting = new LayerSetting(height, width, stepSize, depth, random);

LayerSetting skyLayerSetting = new LayerSetting(128, 128, 16, 0, random);
LayerSetting groundLayerSetting = new LayerSetting(128, 128, 16, 0, random);
LayerSetting undergroundLayerSetting = new LayerSetting(128, 128, 16, 0, random);
```

* Define your own LayerGenerators

```java
LayerGenerator patternGenerator = new LayerGenerator(patternLayerSetting);

LayerGenerator skyGenerator = new LayerGenerator(skyLayerSetting);
LayerGenerator groundGenerator = new LayerGenerator(groundLayerSetting);
LayerGenerator undergroundGenerator = new LayerGenerator(undergroundLayerSetting);
```

* Create your own LayerMap

```java
LayerMap patternMap = patternGenerator.doCreate(LayerType.ANY);

LayerMap skyMap = skyGenerator.doCreate(LayerType.SKY);
LayerMap groundMap = groundGenerator.doCreate(LayerType.GROUND);
LayerMap undergroundMap = undergroundGenerator.doCreate(LayerType.UNDERGROUND);
```

* View your created Map

```java
TileMapViewer.ViewMap("PATTERN", heightScaleFactor, widthScaleFactor, patternMap);

TileMapViewer.ViewMap("SKY", 4, 4, skyMap);
TileMapViewer.ViewMap("GROUND", 4, 4, groundMap);
TileMapViewer.ViewMap("UNDERGROUND", 4, 4, undergroundMap);
```

## Requirements

* You should be familiar with Java family
* You will need a text editor (i.e Notepad++) or IDE (i.e IntelliJ Idea)
* You will need a computer on which you have the rights to install JDK and Java SE dependencies

## About

TileMapGenerator was created to serve three purposes:

**TileMapGenerator is a basically an simple Noise Tile-Map-Generator**

1. To act as a map-viewer which is given noise and generator ratios.

2. To act as a byte-pixel based BufferedImage viewer.

3. To act as a map-generator that you can use in your own games or research purposes.
